ADDENDUM - 2022-06-21

Cog now uses App Sandbox. This requires permission paths to be granted in the
settings, under the General tab. Right clicking the listing allows one to
manipulate the list, including suggesting additions based on the current
playlist. The suggestion dialog will pop up every path and permutation that
isn't covered by an existing valid sandbox token. It is suggested to check
only the paths that are most appropriate to cover most files you will ever
play with Cog. It is not necessary to add either your default Music folder,
your default Downloads folder, or your default Movies folder.


ADDENDUM - 2013-09-30

I have forked this player to continue maintaining it for others to use, as its
original author appears to have left it by the wayside. I will try to continue
updating as I find more things that need fixing, or if I find new features to
add which seem like they would be useful to me or others.

Up to date binaries will be available at the following link:

ADDENDUM - 2018-06-21

You will need to run the following to retrieve all the source code:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Setup your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` like described in [Xcode-config/Shared.xcconfig](https://github.com/losnoco/Cog/blob/main/Xcode-config/Shared.xcconfig) to build the project.

(Add 2022-05-22) Also, be sure to configure the hooks path, so you won't accidentally commit your team ID to a project file:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
